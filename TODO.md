# TODO:

 - Look in to ex3, something is strange there. Number of paths is incorrect, no idea why we are getting all 10 paths.

 - Add tab completion for function names in the compiled binaries, and for examples if running --examples flag, ideally this should not be the sugested way of doing things.

 - Re-visit stack calculations once we know a bit more.
