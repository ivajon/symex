# SYMEX

Symbolic execution engine that operates on LLVM IR. Main use case is to analyze Rust programs but
as it operates on LLVM IR it allows it to analyze all software that can generate LLVM IR.

## Cargo subcommand

A cargo subcommand is available to easily compile Rust programs into bitcode files and run them
in the symbolic execution engine.

It can be installed with

```shell
> cargo install --path cargo-symex
```

For usage instructions see `cargo symex --help`.


## Getting started

Check out the examples contained in `examles/examples`. These can be run with the cargo subcommand

```shell
> cd examples
> cargo-symex --example <example>
```

To compile and run the example `examples/rust_simple` using the cargo subcommand

```shell
> cd examples
> cargo symex --example simple --function rust_simple_test
```

This will display the results of the analysis of the example, showing all the paths it took and
concrete values for all inputs and output.

## Analysing machine code from elf files
Symex can work on machine code by using a separate executor.
To execute machine code load a elf file using the command `cargo symex --elf [path to elf file] --function [function name]`.
This functionality i under active development and is not yet future complete.
There are some notable differences between the llvm-ir executor and this executor namely:
- Functions from symex lib do not work yet.
- Every variable that is not initialized to a value is assumed to be symbolic.
- No return value is shown instead all register values att the end of execution is displayed.
- Only the target `thumbv6m-none-eabi is supported at the moment`.


## Building

### Dependencies

- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), used as a library for decoding the LLVM-IR (internal representation)
  of the program under analysis.
- [boolector](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector), Boolector is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories
  (SMT) solver for the theories of fixed-size bit-vectors, arrays and uninterpreted functions.

The project currently uses LLVM 17 which require a relatively recent version of Rust.

### Devcontainer

As an alternative, a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is provided that automatically installs Rust `1.72` and LLVM 17.

To generate tests use `./symex/compile_tests_dc.sh` instead.

## SYMEX LLVM 14

The older version `symex-llvm-14-legacy` is still avaiable (for now). But it will be phased out later in favor of the more updated version that supports LLVM 17.

Due to LLVM dependencies the current implementation is limited to Rust < 1.64. `cd` to the folder where you want to run `cargo symex` from and override the Rust version to be used as below:

```shell
cd <folder>
rustup override set 1.64
```

Required dependencies for `symex-llvm-14-legacy`

- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), used as a library for decoding the LLVM-IR (internal representation)
  of the program under analysis.

SMT solver defaults to `boolector`. It is possible to use Z3 instead of Boolector by using the feature flag `z3`.

- [boolector](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector), Boolector is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories
  (SMT) solver for the theories of fixed-size bit-vectors, arrays and uninterpreted functions.
- [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), Z3 is a theorem prover from Microsoft Research.

To use the devcontainer with this setup, see the notes in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

## Usage

### Making tests work

The tests make use of compiled LLVM IR files which are not tracked by git. To make the tests work
run

```shell
> ./scripts/compile_tests.sh
```

### Debug output from SYMEX

The implementation uses the Rust log framework. You can set the logging level to the environment variable `RUST_LOG`. See below example (assumes the cargo-sub command `symex`).

```shell
> RUST_LOG=DEBUG cargo symex --example get_sign --function get_sign --release
```

If you want to narrow down the scope of logging you can give a list of modules to log.

```shell
> RUST_LOG="symex=debug" cargo symex --example get_sign --function get_sign --release
```

Symex uses different logging levels:

- info, high level logging of steps taken.
- debug, general logging of important actions.
- trace, further information on internal operations and data structures.

You can also narrow down the scope to specific modules, e.g. the executor.

```shell
> RUST_LOG="symex::executor=trace" cargo symex --example get_sign --function get_sign --release
```


## Known issues

Sometimes when running examples the runner may give

```shell
error: could not copy "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.bc" to "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.bc": No such file or directory (os error 2)

error: could not copy "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.ll" to "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.ll": No such file or directory (os error 2)

error: could not compile `examples` due to 2 previous errors
```

Until the issue is fixed it can remedied by running `cargo clean` and trying again.
